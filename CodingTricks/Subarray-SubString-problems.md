### This ‚Äútemplate‚Äù is a general sliding window + hashmap/array approach for solving a lot of substring problems (like "minimum window substring", "longest substring without repeating characters", "longest substring with at most k distinct characters", etc.). 
###  Steps to solve : 
1. Use two pointers (begin / end or start / end) to represent the current window in the string.
2. Use a map or fixed-size array to store character counts inside that window.
3. Keep a counter to track when your current window meets the problem‚Äôs condition (e.g., contains all required characters).
4. Move end to expand the window until it becomes valid.
5. Move begin to shrink the window when you can, to either find a smaller valid window (for min problems) or drop extra characters (for max problems).
6. The key difference between min and max problems:
   6.1. Minimum substring: update the answer inside the inner loop (while shrinking) because you only want valid, smallest windows.
   6.2. Maximum substring: update the answer after the inner loop because you want the largest valid window.


### Example questions

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Minimum Window Substring
```
public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
    int[] map = new int[128]; // ASCII char frequency
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        map[c]++; // store needed char count
    }

    int start = 0, end = 0, minStart = 0;
    int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int counter = t.length(); // how many chars still needed

    while (end < s.length()) {
        char cEnd = s.charAt(end);
        if (map[cEnd] > 0) counter--; // char is needed
        map[cEnd]--; // decrease count (may go negative if extra char)
        end++;

        while (counter == 0) { // valid window
            if (end - start < minLen) {
                minLen = end - start;
                minStart = start;
            }

            char cStart = s.charAt(start);
            map[cStart]++;
            if (map[cStart] > 0) counter++; // lost a needed char
            start++;
        }
    }

    return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(minStart, minStart + minLen);
}

```
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    int[] map = new int[128]; // count occurrences of chars
    int start = 0, end = 0, counter = 0, maxLen = 0;

    while (end < s.length()) {
        char cEnd = s.charAt(end);
        if (map[cEnd] > 0) counter++; // duplicate found
        map[cEnd]++;
        end++;

        while (counter > 0) { // remove duplicates
            char cStart = s.charAt(start);
            if (map[cStart] > 1) counter--;
            map[cStart]--;
            start++;
        }

        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start);
    }

    return maxLen;

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Longest Substring With At Most K Distinct Characters
```
public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    int[] map = new int[128];
    int start = 0, end = 0, counter = 0, maxLen = 0;

    while (end < s.length()) {
        char cEnd = s.charAt(end);
        if (map[cEnd] == 0) counter++; // new distinct char
        map[cEnd]++;
        end++;

        while (counter > k) { // too many distinct chars
            char cStart = s.charAt(start);
            if (map[cStart] == 1) counter--; // removing a distinct char
            map[cStart]--;
